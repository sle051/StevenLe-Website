        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Steven Le and I am a first year pre-business major at the University of California Riverside. I am currently interested in an internship in the realtor field in hopes to prepare myself for a career in the future. I consider myself to be well prepared for any opportunities in this field from my past experiences. Alongside being a student, I have also worked at Best Buy for a year as a sales consultant, hundreds of hours in volunteer work, and have held numerous student government positions in the past. Iâ€™ve developed extensive communication, negotiation, and excel skills through these experiences. I feel like I would be the perfect candidate for this career as Iâ€™ve held leadership positions such as being the Associated Student Body Vice President my junior year of high school.
<br><br>
        Ever since I was a young teenager, I have been buying and reselling popular items for a profit. It started as a small hobby of mine, until I began to take it more seriously. At the beginning, I would make maybe 30-60 dollars a month. At the peak of this hobby, I would make around 100-200 dollars per transaction weekly. I decided that I wanted to focus more on my career and education, so I put my hobby to the side and started slowing down. From my Junior year in high school, to after graduating, I worked as the Digital Imaging and Computers Sales Consultant at Best Buy. I would be the substitute for the Canon and Sony Expert whenever they were not around. After over one year of working there, I have gained skills that are essential for a career as a realtor. I learned how to communicate to customers, and build clients. Something important that I learned was that customers are one time buyers, but clients are lifetime buyers. I have experienced many sales tactics that will aid me in the sales of houses and property. 
<br><br>
        	During my pastime, I enjoy learning more about the automotive field. In high school, I was considering working at a car dealership as a sales consultant during my college years. I have grown a passion for working and driving cars. My second car, purchased by myself my senior year of high school, was a Scion FR-S. It was my dream car as a teenager, but just before spring break at the University of California, Riverside, the car got totaled in an accident on the freeway towards school. Although this is a massive setback, I choose to take it as a lesson and keep on moving forward. Rather than getting the same car, I am deciding on getting a different car, for different experiences. I feel like new experiences are one of the most important things that a human needs to be able to truly live life. My hobby in cars transformed into an interest in interior design, which developed into an interest in real estate. You will find many more things about me in the rest of this website.
